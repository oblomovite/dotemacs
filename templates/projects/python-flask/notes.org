* MANIFEST.in
A MANIFEST.in file consists of commands, one per line, instructing setuptools to
add or remove some set of files from the sdist. The commands are:
|-----------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Command                                 | Description                                                                                   |
|-----------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| include pat1 pat2                       | Add all files matching any of the listed patterns                                             |
| exclude pat1 pat2                       | Remove all files matching any of the listed patterns                                          |
| recursive-include dir-pattern pat1 pat2 | Add all files under directories matching dir-pattern that match any of the listed patterns    |
| recursive-exclude dir-pattern pat1 pat2 | Remove all files under directories matching dir-pattern that match any of the listed patterns |
| global-include pat1 pat2                | Add all files anywhere in the source tree matching any of the listed patterns                 |
| global-exclude pat1 pat2                | Remove all files anywhere in the source tree matching any of the listed patterns              |
| graft dir-pattern                       | Add all files under directories matching dir-pattern                                          |
| prune dir-pattern                       | Remove all files under directories matching dir-pattern                                       |
|-----------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

The patterns here are glob-style patterns: * matches zero or more regular
filename characters (on Unix, everything except forward slash; on Windows,
everything except backslash and colon); ? matches a single regular filename
character, and [chars] matches any one of the characters between the square
brackets (which may contain character ranges, e.g., [a-z] or [a-fA-F0-9]).
Setuptools also has undocumented support for ** matching zero or more characters
including forward slash, backslash, and colon.

Directory patterns are relative to the root of the project directory; e.g.,
graft example* will include a directory named examples in the project root but
will not include docs/examples/.

File & directory names in MANIFEST.in should be /-separated; setuptools will
automatically convert the slashes to the local platformâ€™s appropriate directory
separator.

Commands are processed in the order they appear in the MANIFEST.in file. For
example, given the commands:

#+begin_src python
graft tests
global-exclude *.py[cod]
#+end_src

the contents of the directory tree tests
will first be added to the sdist, and then after that all files in the sdist
with a .pyc, .pyo, or .pyd extension will be removed from the sdist. If the
commands were in the opposite order, then *.pyc files etc. would be only be
removed from what was already in the sdist before adding tests, and if tests
happened to contain any *.pyc files, they would end up included in the sdist
because the exclusion happened before they were included.
